# Barbershop-Client

## My first Client as Front End Dev.

It was made using HTML5, CSS3 and JS. The reason is I want to show what I can do using just the basic tools of Web Dev.

In this project I did:
  - Fixed Header
  - Translate the menu when the Fixed Header icon is clicked
  - Unfade Up animation in the text, when the screen of the client is over the text
  - Slider using flex-box and translateX
  - Dynamic section using flex-box
  - Web accessibility
  - SEO techniques
